## MCroitoru, Sarateanu Andrei-Cristian
I have created a project that will show the online market of a company that sells kitchens, I wish it will be helpful 
for sellers to attract more clients. Once a pon a time, I had a fiend that was a seller of 
kitchens made by booking, and he wanted to have a website in order to make the booking easier 
and to attract more customers. Also, I have added a cute mascot and I have added mobile version of the web side and in 
such way I have made it responsive.
